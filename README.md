## Design Patterns

### 1. **Strategy Pattern**

### 2. **Factory Pattern**

### 3. **State Pattern**

### 4. **Singleton**

### 5. Chain **Observer** Order Status / Product Invetory

#### Key Points:
- Abstracts the creation process of objects.
- Demonstrate coherence between design patterns in the context of Design Patterns and OOP principles.
- The Factory creates objects that implement specific strategies.
  The Strategy provides interchangeable algorithms that can be dynamically switched.
  The State pattern manages state transitions that affect behavior.
  The Singleton ensures shared resources like configuration are accessed consistently.
- Programming logic and scalability
